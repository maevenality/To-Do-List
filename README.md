# To-Do-List
Creates a list that can be added to, completed, and removed. 

To-Do List Creator

This application contains seven functions that allows you to add items to a list, remove items, mark items as complete, view the list, remove all items from the list, sort the list alphabetically, and print the number of items. The tecnology used to create this application was Visual Studio Code. Some of the problems I faced during the creation of the application was getting the functions to do what they're supposed to do. At times, some functions would work, and others wouldn't, so my partner and I would have to locate the source of the issue which was sometimes just the order of the code. I hope to implement a function that allows you to mark a deadline for certain items and alerts you when said deadline approaches. 

Use the application by first selecting the option to add items to your list. Add as many options as you'd like, then utilize other functions once the list is complete (ex. view list). Once you have completed some items, you may selected the option to mark them as complete, remove items, view the number of items left, etc.
